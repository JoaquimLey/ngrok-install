# ngrok-install
A simple self-sufficient script that installs a ngrok ssh tunnel service that runs on boot for the raspberry pi:

## Install

You'll need your account's `AUTH_TOKEN` get it on your ngrok's dashboard: 
- https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth

On your Pi's shell
1. Copy/Download the `install.sh` file
2. Give permission:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 install.sh
```
3. Run

```bash
sudo ./install.sh <AUTH_TOKEN> <REGION>
```
- `REGION` argument is optional (defaults to `us`)

After the installation is complete you can delete the `install.sh` file.
If you get erros from linux complaining about read-only file system try to run:
```
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
```

----------------------

## Uninstall
To stop/remove ngrok from your pi

On your Pi's shell
1. Copy/Download the `uninstall.sh` file
2. Give permission:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 uninstall.sh
```
3. Run

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

---------------------

## Alias
I've written an alias to make it simple to connect to ngrok tunnels.

On your local machine's `bash`/`zshrc` add:
```
alias ngrok='function _f() { ssh -p "$1" pi@0.tcp."${2:-eu}".ngrok.io } ; _f'
```

### Connect using the alias
Open the terminal and run:
```
ngrok PORT REGION
```

_Since I'm in Europe I've defaulted the alias to `eu`, depending on your region you can change:
`"${2:-eu}"` to your choice of default region, e.g: `"${2:-us}"`_

Now to ssh into any of my pi's I just run

```bash
# 11223 is the PORT number
ngrok 11223

# Same as (depending on your default value)
ngrok 11223 eu

# If I wish to connect to my non-default region, e.g us
ngrok 11223 us
```

### Misc
- You can find the config files in the [manual](manual/) folder if you wish to do it manually.
